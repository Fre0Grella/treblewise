# 08 — Licensing, data provenance, and what must not be copied

This project is public, is meant to stay free and open source, and may one day
have a paid hosted tier alongside it. That only works if every input is traced.
Read this before importing code, weights or images from anywhere.

## This repository

**AGPL-3.0.** Chosen deliberately: the scorer and the autoscorer stay open even
for someone who runs them as a hosted service, which is exactly the guarantee
wanted. A paid tier remains possible — AGPL forbids nothing about charging money,
and as sole copyright holder Marco can license the code differently to whoever he
likes, including himself. That last point only holds while every line is his (or
contributed under terms that allow relicensing), so `CONTRIBUTING.md` asks
contributors to agree to that.

## Prior art: what may and may not be used

| Project | Licence | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| [`bnww/dart-sense`](https://github.com/bnww/dart-sense) (cloned locally on this machine) | CC BY-NC 4.0, README states **non-commercial, non-distributable**. Its author has given Marco permission to use the weights; the scope is being confirmed in writing (2026-09-22) | Until that scope is written down here, treat it as **personal use only**: the weights stay off this repository and out of the app. What they are for is speed — running them locally over captured frames to pre-place the tips, so labelling becomes nudging, and as the accuracy baseline our own model has to beat. Note they were trained with Ultralytics YOLOv8, so they carry the AGPL question below whatever their author permits. |
| [`wmcnally/deep-darts`](https://github.com/wmcnally/deep-darts) | no licence file → all rights reserved | Code off-limits. The *paper* (McNally et al., CVPRW 2021) is citable and its ideas — keypoints-as-objects, homography from four calibration points — are ideas, not code. |
| [`Der-Penz/Scored`](https://github.com/Der-Penz/Scored) | no licence file | Code off-limits. Design reference only (4 board keypoints + dart tip + flight is a sound keypoint set). |
| [`nick-kuhle/darts-180`](https://github.com/nick-kuhle/darts-180) | NOASSERTION | Not used. Cited in doc 03 as a cautionary example of architecture-before-perception. |
| [`hanneshoettinger/opencv-steel-darts`](https://github.com/hanneshoettinger/opencv-steel-darts), `OpenDartboard` | check per repo before touching | Multi-camera Raspberry Pi systems; different problem, not needed. |

Board geometry constants (451 mm board, 170 mm double outer radius, 107 mm treble
outer radius, 8 mm ring beds, 6.35/15.9 mm bull radii, 18° sectors, the segment
order) are **physical measurements of a standardised object**, not anyone's
expression. They are re-derived from the WDF/PDC board specification in
`packages/core/src/board/geometry.ts`, with the spec cited in comments.

## Datasets

| Dataset | Licence | Obligation |
|---|---|---|
| **DeepDarts D1 + D2** — McNally, Vats, Wong, McPhee, *DeepDarts: Modeling Keypoints as Objects for Automatic Scorekeeping in Darts using a Single Camera*, CVPRW 2021. IEEE DataPort, DOI 10.21227/05e7-xs69 | CC BY (IEEE DataPort submission terms) | Attribution in `ml/README.md`, in the model card (which is also the release notes), and in the app wherever the model is used — for now the capture lab's autoscorer panel, until there is an about screen. Download needs a free IEEE account — fetch it manually, never scripted past a login. Not redistributed from this repository. |
| **dartscribe** — Ercan Akyürek, Hugging Face `geforcefan/dartscribe`. Side-view ring cameras, with the board's wire crossings and each dart's position labelled | CC BY-SA 4.0 | Attribution in `ml/README.md` and in the card of every model trained on it. Share-alike: whether that reaches trained weights is unsettled, so a model that used it is treated as CC BY-SA until decided otherwise, which matters for shipping in anything closed. Not redistributed from this repository. |
| **Caller voice**: Chatterbox by Resemble AI (`ResembleAI/chatterbox` on Hugging Face), in its own built-in voice | MIT | The clips in `apps/web/public/caller/` are rendered with it. MIT asks nothing of generated audio; the landing page and the pack's `index.json` credit it anyway. Chatterbox marks its output with an inaudible watermark (Perth). No cloned voice: a cloned voice brings the licence of whatever it was cloned from. The model is not committed; `build-caller-pack.py` downloads it. |
| **Game sounds**: a dart going in, [`Dartsboard`](https://freesound.org/people/Ultra-Edward/sounds/792080/) by Ultra-Edward (Freesound 792080, foley: a wall hit to sound like darts), and a pane of glass breaking, [`Hard Glass Break 2`](https://freesound.org/people/ElevatorFan2020/sounds/861043/) by ElevatorFan2020 (Freesound 861043) | CC0 | Nothing is owed, and the authors are named here anyway. In `apps/web/src/assets/sounds/`: one hit cut out of the dart recording, and the glass whole, both from Freesound's MP3 previews. Sound libraries such as Soundsnap are off-limits: their licences forbid shipping a sound where it can be taken out on its own, which an open repository always allows. |
| **Own captures** (Marco's board) | ours | Stay local by default. If ever published, they get their own licence statement and no faces or identifiable rooms in frame. |
| **In-game corrections** | ours, and the user's | Opt-in. Frames never leave the device unless exported deliberately. Doc 01 states this to the user, not just here. |

## Model training stack

Shipped weights must be trainable under permissive terms, so that the project
keeps the option of a native app or a differently-licensed distribution later.

**Allowed in the shipping path**: PyTorch (BSD-3), `timm` (Apache-2.0, with
per-weight licences checked — ImageNet backbones used here are Apache-2.0 or
BSD), `albumentations` (MIT), `onnx`/`onnxruntime` (MIT), `opencv-python`
(Apache-2.0).

**Allowed for comparison only**: Ultralytics YOLO (AGPL-3.0). This repository's
licence is compatible with it, so an Ultralytics baseline may live here, clearly
marked. But Ultralytics' position is that AGPL extends to models trained with
their code, and a shipped AGPL weight file would permanently block an app-store
release. Therefore: **no weight file produced by Ultralytics is ever committed to
`apps/web/public/models/` or referenced by a release manifest.** The baseline
exists to tell us whether our own trainer is competitive.

**Not allowed**: anything with a non-commercial clause (that includes the
`dart-sense` weights and YOLO-NAS weights), and any model whose training data
provenance cannot be stated.

## Model cards

Every shipped model gets a card in `ml/models/<name>/CARD.md` recording: training
data and its licences, augmentation, hyperparameters, the evaluation table from
doc 03, the device latencies measured, known failure modes, the commit and the
SHA-256 of the exported file. If a model cannot produce that card, it does not
ship.

## Naming and trademarks

The project is called "treblewise". It was called "oche" until October 2026,
and was renamed because several darts scoring apps already use that name; the
old name survives only in identifiers that stored data, installed copies or
released models depend on (the IndexedDB name, the pairing prefix, the ML
sample keys and ONNX metadata keys). A trademark search (EUIPO/TMview) is still
to be done before anything is sold under the new name. DartsMind is a separate product referenced only as prior art. No PDC/WDF
branding, no dartboard manufacturer's marks, and no claim of certification is
used anywhere in the app.
