/**
 * The X01 engine.
 *
 * The event log is the truth: a match is a list of darts (plus corrections),
 * and everything else — whose throw it is, the remaining scores, busts, legs,
 * sets, the winner — is derived by folding that list. Nothing is stored twice,
 * so nothing can disagree with itself, and a bug fixed here retroactively fixes
 * every match in the history.
 *
 * A correction does not mutate the dart it corrects; it replaces its effect when
 * the log is folded, and both readings stay on the record. That is what lets the
 * app measure how often the autoscorer was wrong, and turn each mistake into a
 * labelled training example.
