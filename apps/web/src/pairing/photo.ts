/**
 * Full-resolution photographs from the paired phone.
 *
 * The video that arrives over WebRTC is for watching, not for training: the
 * encoder picks its own resolution from the bandwidth it thinks it has, the
 * H.264 profile the pairing offers stops at 720p, and every frame is lossy
 * twice. A dart tip is a few pixels wide, so the photograph that gets labelled
 * is taken on the phone, from its own camera at full size, and sent across as a
 * file on a channel of its own — a 2 MB JPEG on the control channel would hold
 * every control message up behind it.
 *
 * The protocol is three messages: the laptop asks (`request`), the phone
 * answers with a header (`photo`) and then the bytes in chunks, or with
 * `failed`. Chunks are small because some browsers still refuse data-channel
 * messages over 16 KB.
