/**
 * Did anything change where the model sees a new dart?
 *
 * The model looks at one photograph. Next to a dart already in the board it
 * sometimes sees a second tip that is not there (a black dart, a shadow, the
 * old dart's own barrel), and with nothing to compare it proposes that phantom
 * as the new dart. The app has something to compare: the previous photograph
 * of the same visit, taken before the new dart was thrown. A real new dart
 * changes the pixels where it landed; a phantom sits on pixels that look
 * exactly as they did.
 *
 * Measured on the 124 photographs of 2026-10-03 with tips-v3, on photographs
 * with a dart carried from the one before: right proposals changed by 5.8 grey
 * levels and more (one exception), phantoms beside an old dart by 5.1 at most.
 * Dropping candidates under NEW_DART_CHANGE and proposing the strongest of the
 * rest took right proposals from 85 to 88 and phantoms beside an old dart from
 * 9 to 1 (a Python replay of the app's proposal rule with this measure).
