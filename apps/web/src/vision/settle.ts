/**
 * The capture trigger: decides when the board has changed and gone still,
 * which is the moment worth photographing.
 *
 * The obvious design — "wait for movement, then for stillness" — does not work
 * on a real board, and it is worth writing down why. The camera looks at the
 * board from a metre away; the player throws from 2.37 m *behind* it. Their arm
 * never crosses the frame. The dart is in view for two or three motion-blurred
 * frames and then occupies a few per cent of the board. Averaged over a whole
 * video frame, a dart landing in the treble 20 is a rounding error, so a gate
 * that waits for "movement" waits forever.
 *
 * So this works on two signals instead, both measured on a small greyscale
 * thumbnail of the board region only:
 *
 *   motion  mean |current − previous|, over the whole thumbnail.
 *           Answers "is something happening right now?" — a hand reaching in,
 *           a dart in flight, the camera being knocked.
 *
 *   change  the largest per-block mean of |current − reference|, where the
 *           reference is the board as it was when we last photographed it.
 *           Answers "is there something on the board that was not there
 *           before?" A dart is small but *locally* dense, so a block metric
 *           sees it clearly while a whole-frame mean does not.
 *
 * A frame is worth taking when the scene is still and the board has changed.
 *
 * The thresholds below are starting points, not measurements. `motion` and
 * `change` are exposed so the capture lab can show them while someone throws at
 * a real board, and they should be set from what that shows.
