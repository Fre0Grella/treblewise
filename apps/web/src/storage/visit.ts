 *
 * A label is only a label if it is complete: every dart visible in the
 * photograph has to be marked, or the model is taught that a dart it can see is
 * background. So the second photograph of a visit opens with the first dart
 * already marked where it was, and only the new one is left to tap. The darts
 * stay put between throws, so the old marks are right unless a dart was knocked,
 * and a knocked one can be dragged.
 *
 * A visit is three darts. After the third is saved the board is assumed empty
 * again, because that is when the darts come out; pulling them earlier is what
 * "board cleared" is for.
