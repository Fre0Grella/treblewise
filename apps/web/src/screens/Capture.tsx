/**
 * Camera setup, and the practice round that proves it works.
 *
 * Three steps, once: point the camera, find the board, then **try it**. Try-it
 * is the heart of this screen. You throw a dart, the app photographs the board
 * the moment it settles, you tap the dart in the picture, and it calls the
 * score back at you. That single loop does three jobs at once:
 *
 *  - it shows you whether the camera is set up properly, because a wrong
 *    calibration gives a wrong score and you will hear it;
 *  - it is the least tedious way anyone has found to label training data, since
 *    a dart you have just thrown is a dart you can still see; and
 *  - one throw is one labelled sample, so the count going up is the training
 *    set being built.
 *
 * An earlier version photographed everything and queued it for labelling later.
 * A queue of forty near-identical photographs of a board is a chore nobody
 * finishes, and it was not obvious what it was for. Nothing is stored now
 * unless it has been marked.
 *
 * The darts are not pulled between throws, because a model has to learn the
 * second and third dart of a visit with the first ones in the way. So each
 * photograph opens with the darts already in the board marked where they were
 * (see `storage/visit.ts`), only the new one is left to tap, and nothing is
 * ever saved except by pressing Save: a frame with a visible dart unmarked, or
 * a model's guess nobody checked, would teach the model something wrong. A
 * settle — any moment the board goes still — never saves; a newer photograph
 * waits behind one that is being marked.
