# treblewise

A web app for playing darts: X01 scoring, a spoken caller, checkout help, deep
statistics — and a camera autoscorer that reads the board and scores your darts
for you, running entirely in the browser.

**Play it: <https://fre0grella.github.io/treblewise/>** — X01, tap-the-board scoring and
the spoken caller work today, on a phone or a laptop.

> **Status: experimental autoscoring.** The camera can score darts in a game,
> but only if you switch it on: no model has passed the accuracy bar on
> held-out photos of a real board yet, so it is off by default and every dart
> it enters can be corrected with a tap. See
> [`docs/03-autoscorer.md`](docs/03-autoscorer.md).

## What it is

| | |
|---|---|
| **Play** | X01 (301 → 1001), configurable in/out rule (straight / double / triple / master), legs and sets, 1–8 players. |
| **Score** | Three ways, always interchangeable: press the board, say it out loud, or let the camera read it. Pressing raises a magnifying lens offset from your finger, so you can place a dart in a treble on a phone screen. The camera never gets the last word — you do. |
| **Caller** | The score is spoken, so nobody has to look at the screen. |
| **Checkout** | What to aim at on every finishable score, following the configured out rule. |
| **Stats** | The usual ones (3-dart average, first 9, checkout %, darts per leg, bands, per-double table, session trend) plus the ones that need positions: a heatmap of where your darts land, how tightly they group along and across the sector, what happens when you go at your number, and — from your own spread — **where you should actually aim**, which for most players is not the treble 20. |
| **Camera setup** | Point the phone at your board and the app tells you what to fix — cut off, too dark, too straight on, camera moved — then you mark the four board points once. |
| **Try it** | Throw a dart, tap it in the photograph, hear the score called back. If it is right, the camera is set up properly — and that throw is one labelled training sample. In a game, the same thing happens per visit: **Mark where they landed** corrects the score and files the example. All of it stays on your device until you export it. |
| **Two device modes** | **Solo:** the phone does everything. **Paired:** the phone is only a camera and a laptop does the rest. Pairing is two QR codes and no server at all — or, for a computer with no camera, a 103-character code the phone offers to copy. The video goes straight between the devices and never leaves your network, so it works on a hotspot with no internet. |

Offline-first: it's a PWA, all game data lives on your device, and there is no
account to create.

## Repository layout

```
packages/core/     Board geometry, X01 rules, checkout routes, stats. Pure TS, no DOM.
apps/web/          The app: Vue + Vite, PWA.
docs/              Plan, decisions and the licence map. Start with docs/07-roadmap.md.
ml/                Dataset loading, training, evaluation, ONNX export (Python; see ml/README.md).
services/pair/     (later) Signalling relay for phone↔laptop pairing.
```

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm test          # core rules + geometry
npm run dev       # app on http://localhost:5173
```
